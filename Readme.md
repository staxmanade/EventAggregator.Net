What is this?

It's a single .cs file that can provide a basis for a simple Pub/Sub in memory event aggregator.

Where would I use this?

You can use this to decouple any set of objects in your .net project. It is currently used in [StatLight](http://statlight.codeplex.com) and has had a number of downloads on [NuGet](http://nuget.org/List/Packages/EventAggregator.Net).

How can I use this?

1. Install via NuGet `Install-Package EventAggregator.Net`
2. Checkout the samples project to view some various uses.
